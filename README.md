# Your Project's Name

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

This project is made to present a dance event in Stockholm, Sweden. It is made to create interest and be informing about the most important details of the event (such as date and time).
Navigation is made easy to avoid users having to dig for information, and basic hover animations have been added to make the site feel more interactive without adding unnecessary features.
 
## UX
 
This website is for people interested in the dance competition Bad & Boogie. The website focuses mainly on three types: Audience, Competitors, and Sponsors. 
The design is aiming to be simple and informative, as well as eye-catching. 

Below you can see the user stories for this project. 

### User Stories
- As John, I want to find out when and where the event is so I can go and watch the competition
- As Eva, I want to know what categories there are, and when the sign up deadline is, so I can participate in the competition
- As Kim, I want to know if the event is family friendly 
- As a sponsor, I want to know who is behind the event, what the values it represents are, and how to get in touch with the organisers 


Here below you can see the wireframe that this project is based on. Some changes were made later in the design process to better suit a responsive site.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. 
This project is faily simple and consists of 5 pages that are all linked together (mainly through the navbar).  
The top of each page is the navbar the links together all the pages. 
On the contact page there is a contact form that should send an email to the organiser. 
On the tickets page are four different cards that have a button which should add them to cart. 
There should also be a check out system. 
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...
- Navbar - It allows the users to navigate through the pages of the site by clicking the anchor tags on the top of each page. 
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Properly set up the contact sheet on contact.html
- The add to cart system 
- Add the check-out system

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
- [HTML5](https://html.com/) 
    - This was used for the structure of the pages. 

- [CSS3]()

- [Bootstrap 4.4.1](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - Bootstrap was for used the grid system and for components (forms etc.) to speed up the design process. 

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses the **JQuery** included in Bootstrap 4.4.1 


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
